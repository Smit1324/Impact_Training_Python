# Prims Algorithm

# Graph should be weighted connected and undirected
#     Step1:- Consider any vertices 
#     Step2:- Find all edges selected vertex to all new vertices , select least weighted edges and included in a tree , if least weighted edges form a circle than discarded and consider next least weighted edges and include in a tree minimum spanning tree
#     Step3:- perform step2 until all vertices included in a tree
